Exercise 1:

Whe want our controllers to be available behind a default mapping,
for example: /AXXES/controller-one
             /AXXES/controller-two

This can be done both by Spring Boot properties or providing a servlet configuration bean.

Tips:
    - ConfigurableServletWebServerFactory
    - server.servlet.path


Exercise 2:

Catch requests going to and from the controller.

    - Log a message containing the request path going to the controller.
    - Log a message containing the controller Models attribute 'message'.
    - Log a message when everything is finished.

Tips:
    - Create an interceptor class.
    - Do not forget to configure this interceptor.
