Exercise 1:

Whe want our controllers to be available behind a default mapping,
for example: /AXXES/controller-one
             /AXXES/controller-two

This can be done both by Spring Boot properties or providing a servlet configuration bean.

Tips:
    - ConfigurableServletWebServerFactory
    - server.servlet.path



Exercise 2:

Catch requests going to and from the controller.

    - Log a message containing the request path going to the controller.
    - Log a message containing the controller Models attribute 'message'.
    - Log a message when everything is finished.

Tips:
    - Create an interceptor class.
    - Do not forget to configure this interceptor.



Exercise 3:

Playing around with request mappings:

    - Create a new controller.
    - Add different request mappings to the controller.
        - What happens if two mappings of the same type direct to the same endpoint?
        - What happens if two mappings of a different type direct to the same endpoint?

Extra:
    - Let your first controller point to the '/axxes' endpoint.
    - Add an extra controller with a few mappings point to the '/axxes/extra' endpoint.



Exercise 4:

Passing variables to the endpoint:

    - Create a new Controller.
    - Add a POST method accepting an optional String request parameter.
    - Add a POST method accepting a required integer request parameter.
    - Add a GET method accepting an integer path variable.
